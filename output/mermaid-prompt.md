## Task: Generate Architecture Diagrams

Based on the code above, create the following diagrams using Mermaid syntax:

### 1. Class Diagram
Show all classes, their attributes, methods, and relationships (inheritance, composition, associations).

### 2. Component/Module Diagram  
Show the high-level components and their dependencies/interactions.

### 3. Sequence Diagram
Show the main user interaction flows through the system.

### Requirements:
- Identify all classes and their relationships
- Map out dependencies between modules
- Show data flow and method calls
- Include entry points and main execution paths
- Label all relationships clearly
- Use appropriate Mermaid diagram types (classDiagram, graph, sequenceDiagram)

### Output Format:
Provide complete, valid Mermaid syntax for each diagram type. Each diagram should be standalone and renderable.

Generate the diagrams now.
